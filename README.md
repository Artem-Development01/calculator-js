Accessible Calculator - Educational Project

This is my first JavaScript calculator after 10 months of learning. It has a clean MVC architecture.

IMPORTANT: This is an educational project. 
The calculator processes operations sequentially (left-to-right), 
not with mathematical precedence. 
Example: 2 + 2 × 2 = 8 (not 6)

Features:
- Full accessibility (keyboard, screen readers)
- Responsive mobile-first design
- MVC architecture pattern
- Vanilla JavaScript, no dependencies

Quick start:
1. Clone repository: git clone https://artem-development01.github.io/calculator-js/
2. Open index.html in browser
3. Use with mouse or keyboard
